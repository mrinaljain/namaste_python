# Operators

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

## Arithmetic operators
+ 
- 
/ 
*
% 
** : exponent
// : floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number


## Assignment operators

=
+=	
-=	
*=	
/=	
%=	
//=
**=	
&=	
|=	
^=	
>>=		
<<=	
:=  => Walrus operator : allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression directly

## Comparison Operators

==	Equal	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=

## Logical Operators

and 
or 
not

## Identity Operators

is 
is not

## Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:


in 
not in

## Bitwise Operators

&
||
^
~
<<
>>



## Order of Execution

()	Parentheses	
**	Exponentiation	
+x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
*  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
+  -	Addition and subtraction	
<<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
&	Bitwise AND	
^	Bitwise XOR	
|	Bitwise OR	
==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
not	Logical NOT	
and	AND	
or	OR
