# Strings


- multiline strings can be made by tripple quotes
- strings are array of single characters, just like other languages.
- python doesnot have character datatype

- lenght of string => len(stringNAme)

- To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
```
x in str

```

- To check if a certain phrase or character is not in a string, we can use the keyword in.
```
print("expensive" not in txt)

```

## String Methods
*Note*: All string methods return new values. They do not change the original string.


- Slicing string  => string[start:end] // end not included
   rest all rules are same

### upper()
### lower()
### strip()
### split()
### replace
