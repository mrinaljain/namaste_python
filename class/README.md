## The __init__() Function

- just like constructor in javascript



## The __str__() Function

- The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.

- If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:



## The self Parameter
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.


## Object Methods

- Modify Object Properties
```
p1.age = 40
```

- Delete Object Properties
```
del p1.age
```

- Delete Objects

```
del p1
```


## The pass Statement
class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
