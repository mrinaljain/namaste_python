# Boolean CAsting


- Anything empty will give false

## Exception case 
   - If a type or object doesn't have an explicit boolean interpretation, trying to convert it with bool() will raise a TypeError
   - A callable object is treated as True, regardless of whether it has any meaningful return value or not.
